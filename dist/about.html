            <p>
              Seek-A-Design was a long-time dream of owner and designer,
              Lyandra Sica (seek•uh). Using her last name, she developed
              the play-on-words into her business which has sprouted
              vivdly within the last few years. Within those years,
              her hard work and determination has allowed her dream to
              turn into the reality of being a go-to designer
              and printing expert.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ever since Lyandra was four years old, she knew she
              wanted to be a creator. She accomplished numerous art
              courses in high school and graduated from New York
              Institute of Technology in Manhattan with a Bachelor's
              in Graphic Design. She understood and learned the field
              has many aspects beneath it such as advertising, packaging,
              editorial, and book design, but none caught her attention.
              What truly caught Lyandra's eye was the second half of
              the design operation, print and production. She finds
              it to be the most important piece of a finalized creation,
              because without print, a design will only be just a design.
            </p>

            <p>
              No matter where she has been, she's produced superior
              work because she dedicates making sure each and every
              piece stands to return becuase of the attention to
              detail and the stress-free process that she prides
              herself on.

                “We had the most amazing wedding invitations created
                 by Seek-A-Design! It was cheaper than the prices I
                 found online, and better quality. I received so many
                 compliments that I’m using them again for an upcoming
                 party I’m throwing. We can’t say enough!” - Angela L.

              </li>

              <li>
                “Seek-A-Design helped create invitations, place-cards,
                signage and thank you cards for my great-grandmothers
                centennial celebration. Lyandra was patient, collaborative
                and took into consideration all of our wants while
                still being creative. We received so many complements
                on the quality and graphics from attendees. I will
                definitely use Seek-a-Design for my future event
                and signage needs!” - Valentina C.

              <li>
                “I had Seek-A-Design create some brochures for my
                company with a fairly close timeframe, not only did
                she knock it out of the park that at our latest
                showcase we had other companies coming by to comment
                on how incredible they were compared to their own.
                I would recommend them anytime for anything from work
                related printing, to business cards and invitations.
                A++.” - Tom F.
